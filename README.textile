h1. Generate configuration for ZooKeeper ensemble

http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/

h2. Summary

zkconf.py will generate all of the configuration needed to run a ZooKeeper ensemble. Currently the assumption is that this tool will mainly be used to do testing, therefore the conf files are using localhost for all servers.

h2. Requirements

* Python
* Cheetah templating package are necessary to run this
** On ubuntu "sudo apt-get install python-cheetah"

before using the first time (or on update) run the following command

cheetah compile *.tmpl

h2. Usage

zkconf.py [options] zookeeper_trunk_dir

example: zkconf.py --count 9 ~/zookeeper_trunk

typically you want to create a new subdir, cd into that subdir, then run zkconf.py -- why? because the generated dirs/files are output the the current directory

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COUNT, --count=COUNT
                        ensemble size
  --clientportstart=CLIENTPORTSTART
                        first client port
  --quorumportstart=QUORUMPORTSTART
                        first quorum port
  --electionportstart=ELECTIONPORTSTART
                        first election port

where zookeeper_trunk_dir is the location of your zookeeper trunk - necessary as the source for jars/conf files

start.sh - start the ensemble (logs are output to the respective server subdir)
stop.sh - stop the ensemble
cli.sh "server:port,server:port,..." - open a client to the server list
